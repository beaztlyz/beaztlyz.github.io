  <h3> there is a question to be asked </h5> 
  
   <p>... league of legends, does the team with the more difficult champions, on average win more? or is it the opposite correlation. </p>
    <p> In this study i will conduct multiple comparisons between hard "character"  and review highly ranked competitive gaming matches </p>
  
  
        
  
  
        how i am extracting the data: 
        gathering the difficulty levels of each champion dividing it by five and thats the difficulty_champscore for the blue side of the team
